	<body>
		<p>
			This web page, made by Issac and Michelle, talks about two comedians, Gabriel Iglesias and Kevin Hart.
			Gabriel and Kevin are both stand-up comedians that are very popular in this day and age.
			Not only do these comedians tell us hilarious jokes and stories, they also have had the opportunities to grace us in movies and shows that most us have seen.
			This page will give you a little glimpse in to both of these comedians lives before the stage and how they took off.
			You may also find a list of shows or stand-up acts they have been in and that you may recognize.
